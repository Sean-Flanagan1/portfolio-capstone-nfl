## Problem Statement

Should teams punt or go for it on fourth down?

I wanted to see if teams should punt or go for it on fourth down. One thing that bothers me when watching football is when the announcer says that the coach made a smart decision not getting caught up in the moment when they punt the ball when it is a fourth and one. I wanted to do my own research to find out if the announcer is right. 

## Executive Summary

The goal of the project is to try and predict whether a team should go for it on fourth down or punt. I pulled a NFL Play-by-Play Data set from Kaggle. The dataset was for seasons 2009 through 2018. The dataset contained 449,371 rows and 255 features. I ran multiple classification models trying to find which model could predict most accurately which team should go for it on fourth down or not. The focus should be on accuracy because the coach would want to correctly predict the result of the play whether if it ia a converted fourth down or not. 

## Process

### Dropping Features

Since the NFL dataset was large, importing the data was slow and the data was difficult to read. The first step was to drop unnecessary features. I checked the features and dropped all features that contained more than 100,000 nulls. Afterwards I dropped features that would reveal the result of the play. The dataset had multiple features that included win probability added (wpa) and expected points added (epa). These features would reveal to the model if the team converted on fourth down or not so I dropped these features. I also dropped features that would have nothing do with fourth down (kick return, extra-point, two-point-attempt, etc). After dropping these features, I was able to cut down the dataset to 99 features. I was now able to start exploring the dataset and dive into finding which features are relavent when attempting to go for it on fourth down. 

### EDA

I made the target variable by creating a column for fourth down conversion. 1 if a team converts on fourth down and 0 if the team does not convert on fourth down. With this information, a team successfully converted on fourth down approximately 49% of the time. The next step was splitting the play type into dummy columns to see if the team ran or passed the ball, as well as the formation before the snap. I also decided to make a dummy variable for whether a team was home or not. Playing at home may or may not make it easier to convert on fourth down. I also combined field goal probability and touchdown probability into one total scoring probability to see if that would have any impact on converting on fourth down. However, before digging into creating a model, I wanted to explore expected points added (EPA) and win probability added (wpa) to see the impact of punting or going for it on fourth down.

####  EPA and WPA

| 4th Down Attempt | Win Probability Added | Expected Points Added |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Failed Conversion | -.0409 | -2.4424 |
| Successful Conversion | .0712 | 2.6971 |


| Punt or 4th Down Attempt | Win Probability Added | Expected Points Added |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4th Down Attempt | .0142 | .0830 |
| Punt | -.0815 | -3.5717 |

It appears that teams increase there odds of winning when they attempt to go for it on fourth down compared to punting. However, some more digging needs to be done for this. EPA and WPA can be misleading. Most teams go for it in on fourth down when they are losing in the fourth quarter. Your win probability added for example is not going to drop that much that late in the game if you fail to convert when compared to punting the ball in the second quarter. 

### Models

I ran multiple classification models with accuracy scores ranging from 61% to 65%. The features I used were yards needed for a first down, whether or not the play was a run play, touchdown proability and goal to go. Features like playing on your home field and total scoring proability did not appear to have any significant correlation with converting on fourth down. 

#### Data Dictionary

| Feature | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4th_down_conversion | Integer | 1 if the offense converts on fourth down. 0 if the offense fails to convert on fourth down |
| ydstogo | Integer | Yards needed for a first down |
| run | Integer | 1 if the offense runs the ball. 0 if the offense throws the ball |
| td_prob | Float | Probability of the offense scoring a touchdown (before the fourth down attempt) |
| goal_to_go | Int | 1 if the offense is in the opponents goal line. 0 if the offense is not in the oppents goal line. |

#### Accuracy and Precision Scores

| Model | Accuracy | Precision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Logistic Regression | .6566 | .6131 |
| Boosting | .6558 | .6316 |
| Extra Trees | .6549 | .6429 |
| Random Forests | .6399 | .6047 |
| KNN | .6307 | .6083 |
| Bagging | .6281 | .6065 |
| Dummy (Most Frequent) | .5343 | N/A |
| Dummy (Stratified) | .5293 | .495 |

It describes how good a model is at predicting the positive class. Precision is referred to as the positive predictive value.
